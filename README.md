# Portfolio-Site
Portfolio Site using express and pug.  Showing off the projects I've created through TeamTreehouse.com.


This project uses express and pug to set up a full-stack website, running on the computer as the server.  Examples are given of five of my previous projects, with potential to add more as needed.  Project pages are created using information from a JSON file, which can be edited to add more projects in the future.  An "about" page is included, with some basic information about me.  Also, error-handling is included, in case someone attempts to access a site that is not part of the overall website(ex: /abot instead of /about would return a 404-page not found error).  


To meet the exceeds criteria, the three required color customizations are as follows:
1. Changing the background color of the index section to light steel blue.
2. Switching the top navigation bar(on a narrower screen) to white text on a black background instead of black text on a white background.
3. On the project pages, thickening the borders of the sample pictures.  I also added descriptive text above each picture.
